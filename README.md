# Password-Generator
In this assignment, I was tasked with creating an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on the criteria they have selected. The app will run in browser and will feature dynamically updated html and css powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screenn sizes.
